# Start with Security-Cam

Now that you have set up your Raspberry Pi, you can start with the Security-Cam project.

## Installation

Clone the Repository

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/infinitel8p/Security-Cam.git /opt/security-cam
sudo chown -R pi:pi /opt/security-cam
sudo chmod -R u+rwX /opt/security-cam
```

Install Node.js and npm

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
```

## Setup

:::warning
The following steps are subject to change. They are based on the current state of the project and may be outdated.
Since the project is still in development, the setup process may change in the future.
:::

Allow pi to Run chmod Without Password:

```bash
sudo visudo
```

Add the following line:

```bash
pi ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/chmod +x /opt/security-cam/start.sh
```

Create the Service File

```bash
sudo bash -c 'cat <<EOF > /etc/systemd/system/security-cam.service
[Unit]
Description=Security Cam Flask and Node.js Servers
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=/opt/security-cam
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod +x /opt/security-cam/start.sh
ExecStart=/opt/security-cam/start.sh
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF'
```

Reload the systemd manager configuration

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Enable the service to start on boot

```bash
sudo systemctl enable security-cam.service
```

Start the service

```bash
sudo systemctl start security-cam.service
```

Check the status of the service

```bash
sudo systemctl status security-cam.service
```

You should now be able to access the Security-Cam web interface by navigating to `http://<raspberry-pi-ip>:5000` in your web browser.

The ip address of your Raspberry Pi can vary. If you are connected to the Raspberry Pi's AP and you have followed the instructions on how to set it up, you can access the web interface by navigating to `http://192.168.10.1:5000` in your web browser. If you are connected to the same network as the Raspberry Pi, you can find the ip address by running `hostname -I` on the Raspberry Pi.
