# Bluetooth Setup

## Pairing

Ensure your Bluetooth device's visibility is turned on.
On the Raspberry Pi, enter the following command:

```bash
bluetoothctl
```

In the bluetoothctl prompt, enter the following commands:

```bash
agent on
```

```bash
default-agent
```

```bash
scan on
```

Once you see the MAC address of your device, pair with it using (replace `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` with the **Bluetooth** MAC address of your target device):

```bash
pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

Then trust the device:

```bash
trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

Now type `exit` to exit the bluetoothctl prompt.
