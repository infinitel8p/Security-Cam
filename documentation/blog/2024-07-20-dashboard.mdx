### Building a dashboard

Today i started building a dashboard for our project by following JavaScript Mastery's [tutorial](https://youtu.be/6a3Dz8gwjdg) after struggling to decide on a design and layout.
I figured I'll learn something new by using the Refine Framework and see where this goes.
The plan for now is to rebuild the dashboard from the video to get a better understanding of the Refine Framework and how it works.

After that I'll start working on the actual dashboard for our project (probably by changing the components and some other stuff).
The video seems promising and I'm excited to see how it will turn out.

The first issue i've encountered is (hopefully) only a minor dependency issue with the `AuthBindings` import.

```tsx
import { AuthBindings } from "@refinedev/core";
```

It seems like the import is deprecated so i hope it will be an easy fix.

```c
'AuthBindings' is deprecated.ts(6385)
```

We'll see how it goes.
