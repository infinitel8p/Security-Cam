However, I noticed a recurring issue: the video stream would consistently freeze whenever a recording started, only resuming after the recording was complete. While this wasn\'t a big problem, it was frustrating enough to warrant a closer look.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nTo address this, I decided to explore an alternative approach using `OpenCV`. I wrote a small test script that streams frames to a `Flask` endpoint. After modifying the `ClientVideoPlayer` component in our placeholder dashboard, I successfully established a stable video stream. The next step was to test whether the video could be recorded while maintaining a continuous and stable feed to the dashboard\u2014and I\'m happy to report that this was a success.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result, we\'re transitioning from using `picamera` and `WebSockets` for streaming to using `Flask` and `OpenCV`. While I still have a few more tests to conduct before finalizing this decision, resolving the most frustrating issue from the old code feels like a significant step forward."},{"id":"starting-the-dashboard","metadata":{"permalink":"/Security-Cam/blog/starting-the-dashboard","editUrl":"https://github.com/infinitel8p/Security-Cam/edit/main/documentation/blog/2024-07-25-start.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-25-start.mdx","title":"Build a Dashboard","description":"Starting to build the Dashboard","date":"2024-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Dashboard","permalink":"/Security-Cam/blog/tags/dashboard","description":"Web Interface related posts."},{"inline":false,"label":"Next","permalink":"/Security-Cam/blog/tags/next","description":"Next.js related posts."}],"readingTime":0.655,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ludovico Ferrara","title":"Maintainer of Security-Cam","url":"https://github.com/infinitel8p","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50703696?s=400&u=761df587f17316eb28a4768b8092ec4dbc137f1c&v=4","key":"ludo","page":null},{"name":"Lennert Pfundtner","title":"Front End Engineer","url":"https://github.com/KrokoNinja","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79910460?v=4","key":"lenni","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"starting-the-dashboard","title":"Build a Dashboard","authors":["ludo","lenni"],"tags":["dashboard","next"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Fix the stream","permalink":"/Security-Cam/blog/fix-the-stream"},"nextItem":{"title":"The start of something new","permalink":"/Security-Cam/blog/welcome"}},"content":"### Starting to build the Dashboard\\r\\n\\r\\nToday we started building the first steps of the dashboard.
